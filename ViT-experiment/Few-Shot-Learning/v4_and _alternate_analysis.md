# Few-Shot Learning Approaches Comparison

## Overview

Comparison of two few-shot learning methodologies applied to cybersecurity attack classification using Vision Transformer (ViT) models on 5-channel 32x32 network payload representations.

## Data & Model Validation ✅

Both notebooks utilize identical experimental setups:

- **Pre-trained Model**: `/home/ubuntu/Cyber_AI/ai-cyber/notebooks/ViT-experiment/best_6class_vit_model.pth`
- **Model Architecture**: 2,917,830 parameters, 5-channel 32x32 ViT
- **Held-out Classes**: DDoS-HTTP_Flood, DoS-UDP_Flood, Recon-PortScan
- **Dataset**: Same `held_out_X.npy` and `held_out_y.npy` (36,000 samples)
- **Training Classes**: Benign_Final, DictionaryBruteForce, SqlInjection, DoS-TCP_Flood, DDoS-SYN_Flood, Mirai-udpplain

## Methodological Differences

### v4 Notebook: Simple Prototypical Networks
- **Approach**: Basic prototypical networks
- **Training**: No additional training - direct feature extraction
- **Method**: 
  1. Extract features using pre-trained ViT
  2. Compute class prototypes (average support features)
  3. Classify based on Euclidean distance

### Alternate Notebook: Advanced Meta-Learning
- **Approach**: Two sophisticated strategies
- **Strategy 1**: Episodic meta-learning with fine-tuning
- **Strategy 2**: Frozen backbone with extensive evaluation
- **Method**:
  1. 80/20 train/test split on held-out data
  2. Episodic training (2000 episodes)
  3. Comprehensive k-shot analysis

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | v4 (Simple) | Alternate (Advanced) | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **3-way 5-shot Accuracy** | 80.00% | **93.43%** | **+16.8%** |
| **Training Method** | None | Meta-learning | Advanced |
| **Evaluation Robustness** | Single run | 1000 episodes | More robust |

## Per-Class Performance

| Class | v4 Results | Alternate (Implied) |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| **DDoS-HTTP_Flood** | 70.00% | ~93%+ |
| **DoS-UDP_Flood** | 100.00% | ~93%+ |
| **Recon-PortScan** | 70.00% | ~93%+ |

## K-Shot Analysis (Alternate Only)

| K-Shot | Accuracy | Improvement |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **1-shot** | 84.37% | Baseline |
| **2-shot** | 90.55% | +6.18% |
| **5-shot** | 93.53% | +9.16% |
| **10-shot** | 93.97% | +9.60% |

## Key Insights

### 1. Meta-Learning Advantage
The **16.8% improvement** demonstrates the power of episodic meta-learning vs. simple prototypical networks.

### 2. Diminishing Returns
Performance plateaus after 5-shot (93.53% → 93.97%), suggesting optimal support set size.

### 3. Robustness
The alternate approach provides more reliable estimates through:
- 1000-episode evaluation
- Multiple k-shot experiments
- Proper train/test splits

### 4. Both Validate Core Hypothesis
Both approaches achieve **>80% accuracy**, confirming that:
- Pre-trained ViT features transfer well
- Class selection improvement (v3→v4) was crucial
- Visual similarity (SqlInjection→Recon-PortScan) enables transfer

## Academic Contributions

**v4 Notebook**: Demonstrates basic few-shot feasibility

**Alternate Notebook**: Provides rigorous meta-learning analysis with:
- Proper episodic training
- Comprehensive k-shot analysis  
- Statistical robustness (1000 episodes)
- Performance ceiling analysis

## Visual Feature Analysis

Both experiments confirm that visual similarity in 5-channel network payload representations correlates with semantic attack similarity. The successful transfer from SqlInjection to Recon-PortScan (evidenced by 70%+ accuracy) demonstrates that the ViT learned meaningful attack behavior representations where visually similar network patterns correspond to semantically related attack types.
